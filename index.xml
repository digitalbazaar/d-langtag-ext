This document specifies an Extension to BCP 47 which provides subtags that
specify language direction.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
<xref target="RFC5646" ></xref> permits the definition and registration of
language tag extensions "that contain a language component and are compatible
with applications that understand language tags". This document defines an
extension for identifying text direction using language tags. The "singleton"
identifier for this extension is 'd'.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

    <section title="RFC5646 Required Information">
      <t>
Language tags, as defined by <xref target="RFC5646"></xref>, are useful for
identifying the language of content. Some operating environments also
use the language tag to determine text direction, which can be problematic.
This extension provides a mechanism for explicitly stating the direction
of a specific language-tagged string.
      </t>

      <section title="Summary">
        <t>
The subtags available for use in the 'd' extension consist of the values
'ltr', 'rtl', and 'auto' for expressing text direction that is "left-to-right",
"right-to-left", and "automatically detected", respectively.
        </t>
        <t>
For example, the language tag "ar-d-rtl" consists of:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
The base language tag "ar" (Arabic), exactly as defined by
<xref target="RFC5646"  />.
            </t>
            <t>
The singleton 'd', identifying this extension.
            </t>
            <t>
The attribute 'rtl', which specifies a direction of "right to left".
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
Only the first occurrence of an attribute or key conveys meaning in a language
tag. When interpreting tags containing the direction extension, duplicate
attributes or keywords are ignored in the following way: ignore any attribute
that has already appeared in the tag and ignore any keyword whose key has already
occurred in the tag.
         </t>
         <section title="Canonicalization" anchor="canonicalization">
           <t>
As required by <xref target="RFC5646"  />, the use of uppercase or lowercase
letters is not significant in the subtags used in this extension. The
canonical form for all subtags in the extension is lowercase.
The canonical order of attributes is in <xref target="US-ASCII" />
order (that is, numbers before letters, with letters sorted as lowercase
US-ASCII code points). The canonical order of keywords is in
<xref target="US-ASCII" /> order by key. The order of subtags within a keyword
is significant; the meaning of this extension is altered if those subtags
are rearranged. Thus, the canonical form of the extension never reorders the
subtags within a keyword.

otherwise impact IANA.
